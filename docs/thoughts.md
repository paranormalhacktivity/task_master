Began this project with the goal in mind, of getting exposure to various other languages,
outside of my native language of Ruby. In order to get the most out of it, I wanted to
pursue a project, that would be fairly trivial, yet complex enough to be enjoyable. So
I asked ChatGPT to provide me with various ideas, and while many were good, I settled on
it's suggestion of creating a task report generator. I love working with data, it's very
familiar to what I do on a day-to-day basis, in my work's Rails projects. We are consistently
looking for various ways to show data in a way that provides most value to the clients using
our system. I'm always surprised by all of the various stories that data can paint, for
better or worse. And with the idea of this simple task report generator, I foresaw many
oppurtunities to practice architectural design, as thoughts of opening up the system to
different UIs and data sources danced in my head. I would really get to flex many muscles
with a project like this. So, with all that said, I very much felt like this was my prime
project prospect.

Naturally, I started with my native language of Ruby. The good thing about
Ruby, is that the language is so eloquent, that getting thoughts on screen, takes no
time, and is very easy to change as nuance about the project is learned. It really is
probably the best language for prototyping, and I felt this when I subsequentally proceeded
onward to Javascript. Although, Javascript is quite different syntactically, than Ruby, I still
felt myself using the Ruby code as a template for how I would structure the Javascript
code. It basically became a matter of translating the ideas between the two languages.
I think this is a simple approach to playing with a new language.
I've noticed subtle differences, like explicit function returns and callback requirements,
which highlight unique aspects of Javascript. While efficient, this
approach made me ponder if I may have missed oppurtunities to learn language-specific concepts
organically. Regardless, I do feel that it builds a foundational knowledge that could facilitate
a more in-depth exploration later on.

My aim is to emerge from this endeavor as a more versatile developer, gaining
insights from different languages. I believe diverse language exposure provides
perspectives that a monolingual approach might miss. As I continue, I plan to
reflect more explicitly on language-specific concepts and deepen my understanding.

Uhhhhhhh... Javascript dates are zero-indexed on the month, but only the month?! Year
and day are represented normally, starting from 1? WTF, dude?! Huuuuuge gotcha! That is
so confusing and I absolutely, without a doubt, hate that. I hate that. I hate it so much.
Why do that? That is so confusing. Still about halfway through the project rewrite in
Javascript, so there's still time for my opinions on the language to change, but so far,
I hate the atrocities that I've seen here today. Still gonna try and dig into some
language-specific concepts. Maybe I'll find a redeeming quality for javascript, but
I am not hopeful.

Long time, no entry. I have finally come to a stopping point in my javascript expedition,
and although, I uncovered several shortcomings, things that I missed in my first pass using
ruby, I have at least produced a program of equal behavior in javascript and now feel I
am at a reasonable place, to push up code, and possibly document some things that I missed
as issues, so that I can come back later. Which does beg the question, should I take the
time, to do those issues now, or am I gonna be impatient and move on to the next iteration
in a new language? An even jucier question, what language is next...?
